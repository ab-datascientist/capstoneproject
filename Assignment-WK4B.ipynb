Introduction: Problem\n2. Data\n    * Data Sources\n    * Feature Selection\n    * Data Cleaning \n3. Methodology\n4. Analysis\n5. Results and Discussion\n6. Conclusion\n\n**1.** **Introduction: Problem**\n\nThe question that we are trying to answer here is: How safe are we when we visit one of the popular venues in Boston, MA? The answer to this question can not only help individuals secure their personal safety but also help them in being better prepared to face an unforeseen unfortunate event. But beyond this obvious benefit, the answers to this question can also help in identifying the concentration of types of crimes around venues and this in turn can be utilized by law enforcement agencies in evolving an effective strategy to curb crimes. In addition the business owners of such venues can utilize the information to devise better business strategies by exactly knowing what types of crimes occur around them more frequently.\n\n**2.** **Data**\n\n**2.1 Data sources**\n\nTo start answering our question we need data for venues and crime incidents in Boston. Crime incident data is provided by Boston Police Department (BPD). This dataset is updated regularly and contains records which includes set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. The data set has information of crime incidents from year 2015 to date. As of February, 2019 the dataset contains 364,577 entries\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image002.png)\n\nThe venue data is aggregated by leveraging the Foursquare\\[1\\] location data. The explore end point of Foursquare API, `_https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore_`  returns a list of recommended venues near the current location expressed as latitude and longitude for that location. The returned results are limited by the parameters of GET request such as `_radius_` which governs the radius to search within (in meters) and `_limit_`  which governs the number of results returned. In addition Foursquare Developer Account Type and Type of API call (Regular or Premium) determine the daily call quota.  Venue data is aggregated as `_groups_`  field of json response.\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image003.png)\n\n**2.2 Feature Selection**\n\nThe only relevant features of crime dataset are the ones that describe the type of crime, the place of occurrence, date and year when they occurred so we select _ 'offense\\_group', 'street', 'occurred\\_on\\_date', 'year', 'lat', 'long\u2019 _ and drop rest of the features from the crime incident data provided by BPD. Subsequently the selected features are renamed as _'Offense', 'Street', 'Date', 'Year', 'Latitude', 'Longitude'_ and a new Geo Spatial dataset of Boston\u2019s crime incidents **_bostonCIGeo_ _\\_df_** is created.\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image004.png)\n\nSimilarly, the relevant fields in the json response obtained from the explore endpoint of Foursquare API are venue\u2019s name, category and its latitude, longitude which are extracted to create Boston Venues dataset **_bv\\_df_**.\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image005.png)\n\nThese two datasets form the core data for further analysis. But before we can go any further we need to clean this data and remove inconsistencies.\n\n**2.3 Data Cleaning**\n\nIt is observed that geo-spatial dataset of Boston\u2019s crime incidents has null values for Latitude and Longitude in many recorded incidents, but as part of our analysis, that I describe shortly, such values are required in ascertaining the vicinity of a reported incident to a given venue. Thus we have to discard all such incidents were Latitude or Longitude information is missing in geo-spatial dataset of Boston\u2019s crime incidents any attempt to substitute these values using statistical models would wrongly classify the occurrence of such incidents. There is at least a 5-10% information loss though in the process.\n\nThe street feature in geo-spatial dataset of Boston\u2019s crime incidents although not significant for analysis we intend to perform is shown on marker pop up of a crime incident plotted on the map that has markers for both venues and crime incidents. It is always useful when looking at a venue on the map so see what incident has occurred in vicinity of such venue at what place however many of the reported incidents has no street information. It was decided to substitute the string Latitude, Longitude in place of missing values.\n\n![image011](Assignment-WK4B_files/image006.jpg)\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image007.jpg)\n\nThe geo-spatial dataset of Boston\u2019s crime incidents was limited to incidents that have occurred in the year 2019 to make the analysis relevant to the current times. The intention of the analysis is to show the current scenario devoid of bias that any past data might create. A meaningful slice of the data should be selected in accordance with the objectives of the analysis.\n\nThe data obtained from Foursquare API contained duplicate values for venue names, this creates a negative bias towards venues in our analysis in the sense that they gain more weightage as being places in whose vicinity crimes are committed and thus the first occurrence of the repeated venue name was taken and others dropped.\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image008.png)\n\n![](Assignment-WK4B_files/image009.png)",
